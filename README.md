When no text is given the command will wait for text from the command line which can be ended with ```ctrl+Z```. It's also possible to pipe text into the cowsay program, e.g.:

## Environment ##

To tell the ```cowsay``` package where the cows are, set your ```COWPATH``` environment variable to the directory these cows are in. At the moment only **one** path can be set, e.g.:

```
set COWPATH=A:/cows
```

## Add your own cow templates ##
These are the simplest sorts of cows; they are just a plaintext file with the ASCII that is the cow in it. It has extension '.cow'.  

Use $eyes, $tongue and $thoughts in the file. $eyes and $tongue are replaced by the user-specified eyes and tongue, being strings of length two (if the user specifies longer eyes only the first two characters are used; if they specify a one-character eye it is padded with a space). The $thoughts token is the 'stem' part of the speech bubble, not the speech bubble itself. For a cow that is thinking, this is 'o' (dots leading up to the thought bubble); for a cow that is speaking, this is '\' (speech bubble stem).  

Any line starting with a '#' will be ignored, even if it is part of your cow!. If your cow has lines that start with '#' that should be part of the cow, indent the entire cow one space.  

Example (the default cow, you can see him at the start of the Readme):

```
# e.g. as default.cow
        $thoughts   ^__^
         $thoughts  ($eyes)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
             $tongue ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

# Developer notes #

To compile the source code, use the ```ccfull.bat``` batch file. Don't forget to edit the batch file for the standard C libraries, beware that this line can't be longer then 127 chars!
